# Composable Prompts

## Bring the power of LLMs to your applications

Composable Prompts facilitates rapid API development atop LLMs to power applications. Bring composition, templating, testing, caching, and visibility to the world of LLMs.

As a first step we're solving those key pain points for all developers integrating generative AI into their applications:

- Prompts reuse and templating to easily manage and reuse prompts segments accross tasks

- Easy model switch to experiment with several models: you can choose any model running on OpenAI, Huggingface, and Replicate and test your tasks

- Observability to see how the tasks are performed

- Typescript integration to type all tasks in/out the LLM and ensure a better code quality

## Mission

While LLMs like GPT have fundamentally changed our interaction with textual data, we believe in taking a step further. We aim to ensure that every business, regardless of its scale or domain, can leverage the native data processing capabilities of LLMs in the most efficient manner possible.

## What We Do

We've built the [API Studio for LLMs](https://docs.composableprompts.com/), a comprehensive toolkit for designing, deploying, and operating business-specific APIs. Our suite offers a structured, domain-specific approach, shifting from rudimentary, text-based interactions to a world of structured, efficient, and integrated content processing.

Our Core Offerings:

- **Interaction Designer**: Crafting intuitive prompt templates and robust data schemas.

- **Prompt Assistance**: Using LLMs to enhance prompt design and offer improvement suggestions.

- **API Service**: Seamlessly integrating LLMs into your applications and business processes.

- **Cache Service**: Ensuring optimal performance by intelligently storing and reusing Interaction Results.

- **Collaboration & Optimization Tools**: From sharing prompt segments to monitoring performance, we have developers covered.
